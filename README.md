# Appian Deployment REST API Examples
The examples in this repository can be used to script the Appian Deployment Rest API for deployment automation with most continuous integration environments including Azure Devops, Jira, GitHub, GitLab and more.   

The repository was created to hold the samples I created for my Appian World 2024 presentation.
